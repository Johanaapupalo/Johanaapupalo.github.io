1. Describe the path an HTTP Request takes from a browser to your GitHub Pages site.


2. We discussed Docker Containers in class. Explain how a Docker Container differs from the
environment provided by GitHub Pages.
when we want o use different version of diffrent packages, we can use Docker to make continers and each containers has its own version of the whole sytem and folders. We use this because when we work with someone and want them to have access to the same set up, then we sent an image (all the libraries needed) so that they can have your version installed into their computer very quickly. While github pages is a file server that only delivers static website files, unlike Docker it can not run backend code, host API's or have full control over the server enviroment.
3. AI Attribution: If you used GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help write code, you must

manually
